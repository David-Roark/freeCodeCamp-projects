                <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time.</p>
                <p>Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
                    the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>, which arises from relativity theory, has
                    been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific
                    papers and 150 non-scientific ones. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".</p>
                <p>In 18 April 1955 Princeton, New Jersey, U.S, he was died at age of 76. <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"><i>See more.</i></a></p>

        <h2>Here is Albert Einstein's time line</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1879:</b> was born in German.</li>
            <li><b>1880:</b> the family moved to Munich.</li>
            <li><b>1903:</b> married Marić.</li>
            <li><b>1905:</b> was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich.</li>
            <li><b>1905:</b> the Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc<sup>2</sup> that Einstein published in
                the Annalen der Physik scientific journal.</li>
            <li><b>1908:</b> was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.</li>
            <li><b>1911:</b> became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University.</li>
            <li><b>1911:</b> published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the
                theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.</li>
            <li><b>1912:</b> was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich.</li>
            <li><b>1913:</b> became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.</li>
            <li><b>1916:</b> was elected president of the German Physical Society.</li>

            <li><b>1917:</b> applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.</li>

            <li><b>1919:</b> married Elsa Löwenthal.</li>
            <li><b>1920:</b> became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</li>
            <li><b>1922:</b> was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</li>
            <li><b>1933:</b> moved to US.</li>
            <li><b>1935:</b> collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges.</li>
            <li><b>1940:</b> became an American citizen.</li>

            <li><b>1955:</b> was died in US.</li>
